Programmer Notes
~~~~~~~~~//////////
The danger of this procedure is that come July 1st of the year, it will automatically set
to open the newest files of a non-numbered Panorama file. And if those don't exist, you're 
gonna see errors. Also, a non numbered Panorama file that needs to call older files shouldn't
use this macro



To use these variables please note the following Panorama syntax rules:


filenames using variables:
    can just concatenate as a string
    
    ex:
        
    openfile str(variable)+"filename" 


field calls using variables:
    must be only one variable and nothing else
    must be surrounded by ( )
    
    ex:
    
    field (VariableFieldName)
    
do your math and/or concatenation into the variable before calling it
    VariableFieldName=str(variable)+"fieldname"
 
field (variable+fieldname) does not work
    
for assignments to that variable'd field 
    use «» for "current field/current cell" 
    
    ex: 
   
    «» = "10"
